/*
* bebop_joystick:
*
* This software provides a connection between an USB-Joystick and the Parrot Bebop 2 driver
*
* It receives the joystick state from the joy-node and publishes the corresponding commands to the driver
*
* Author: Nikolas Engelhard
*
* Edit: Seong Hun Lee
*       - Implemented the algorithm used in the paper "Stability-based Scale Estimation of Monocular SLAM for Autonomous Navigation"
*       - Specifially, the algorithm implemented in this project is the height control using velocity commands
*
* Edit: Sebasti√°n Mayorga Castro
*       - Updated and fixed the code for Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic
*       - Modified the code to work with an XBOX 360 USB controller and Bebop Autonomy driver
